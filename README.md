# Rust practice
This repo is my journey to master Rust. I'll first go through the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) with minor explorations, then try to implement common data structures and algorithms in Rust.

Since this is just a practice repo, we don't want to add git sumbodules for each example, so do
```
cargo new --vcs=none my-new-project
```

## Data structures
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Heap
- Queue
- Hash Table
- Trees
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Self-Balancing Trees
    - AVL Tree
    - Red-Black Tree
  - Minimum Spanning Tree (optional)
  - B-Tree (optional)
  - B+ Tree (optional)
- Graph
- Trie (optional)


## Algorithms
- Search (on all types of data structures)
- Sorting
- Traversal (on all types of data structures)

## development
I found it useful to remove the inlay hints after a closing brace in rust-analyzer for VS Code.
